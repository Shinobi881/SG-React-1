Simply put, Wilson has taste; when he enters the recording studio, he has a clear vision of what he wants his next record to sound like. Aside from all this, he's also an extremely hard worker and a major road hog, spending upwards of 200 nights a year on the road, playing festivals and clubs throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe with his own Kim Wilson band and leading the Fabulous Thunderbirds.</P>\r\n<P>Although he's long been known as the charismatic frontman for the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Wilson's solo albums -- which feature bands of his own choosing for different tracks -- is where the genius in his work shows through most clearly. Born January 6, 1951 in Detroit, Michigan, Wilson grew up in California. His parents were singers who would sing popular standards on the radio, and while Wilson took trombone and guitar lessons, he didn't discover blues until he was a senior in high school. Wilson's father later worked for General Motors and raised his family in Goleta, California. Wilson dropped out of college and began playing blues full-time in 1970. He had a rented room and lived the hippie existence, getting his harmonica chops together by playing with traveling blues musicians like Eddie Taylor. Even though Wilson had only switched to harmonica in his senior year in high school, his progress on the instrument was rapid and every bit as all-consuming as his blues record-buying habit. Charlie Musselwhite, John Lee Hooker, and Sonny Rhodes were among the other Bay Area musicians Wilson befriended and worked with in clubs. But Wilson didn't meet his biggest mentor until after he moved to Austin in the mid-'70s.</P>\r\n<P>\"Muddy Waters was my biggest mentor. He really made my reputation for me, and that was a fantastic time of my life, being associated with that man,\" he recalled of his early days with the Fabulous Thunderbirds in Austin. There, at Antone's blues nightclub, Wilson and his Thunderbirds would back up whoever came into town, and it didn't take long for the band to earn Waters' blessing.</P>\r\n<P>As a songwriter, Wilson takes his cue from the long-forgotten names like Tampa Red, Roosevelt Sykes, and Lonnie Johnson. His 1993 solo album, Tigerman, for the Austin-based Antone's label, features just three of his own tunes. Being the student of the blues that he is, Wilson was understandably hesitant to record too many of his own tunes when he'd already had a vision in his head of how he was going to rework classics like Joe Hill Louis' \"Tiger Man,\" the album's title track. He followed up his debut with the equally brilliant That's Life (1994), also for Antone's, and again this recording contains just three self-penned songs. Wilson's career took a boost in the '90s with a major-label deal with Private Music/BMG for the Fabulous Thunderbirds and frequent concert appearances with Bonnie Raitt. Wilson's solo albums are solid productions, highly recommended for harmonica students and fans of classic Texas blues and rhythm &amp; blues.</P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P STYLE=\"line-height: 19.2pt;\"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Tickets are valid for one show only.

Aside from all this, he's also an extremely hard worker and a major road hog, spending upwards of 200 nights a year on the road, playing festivals and clubs throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe with his own Kim Wilson band and leading the Fabulous Thunderbirds. \nAlthough he's long been known as the charismatic frontman for the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Wilson's solo albums -- which feature bands of his own choosing for different tracks -- is where the genius in his work shows through most clearly. Born January 6, 1951 in Detroit, Michigan, Wilson grew up in California. His parents were singers who would sing popular standards on the radio, and while Wilson took trombone and guitar lessons, he didn't discover blues until he was a senior in high school. Wilson's father later worked for General Motors and raised his family in Goleta, California. Wilson dropped out of college and began playing blues full-time in 1970. He had a rented room and lived the hippie existence, getting his harmonica chops together by playing with traveling blues musicians like Eddie Taylor. Even though Wilson had only switched to harmonica in his senior year in high school, his progress on the instrument was rapid and every bit as all-consuming as his blues record-buying habit. Charlie Musselwhite, John Lee Hooker, and Sonny Rhodes were among the other Bay Area musicians Wilson befriended and worked with in clubs. But Wilson didn't meet his biggest mentor until after he moved to Austin in the mid-'70s. \n\"Muddy Waters was my biggest mentor. He really made my reputation for me, and that was a fantastic time of my life, being associated with that man,\" he recalled of his early days with the Fabulous Thunderbirds in Austin. There, at Antone's blues nightclub, Wilson and his Thunderbirds would back up whoever came into town, and it didn't take long for the band to earn Waters' blessing. \nAs a songwriter, Wilson takes his cue from the long-forgotten names like Tampa Red, Roosevelt Sykes, and Lonnie Johnson. His 1993 solo album, Tigerman, for the Austin-based Antone's label, features just three of his own tunes. Being the student of the blues that he is, Wilson was understandably hesitant to record too many of his own tunes when he'd already had a vision in his head of how he was going to rework classics like Joe Hill Louis' \"Tiger Man,\" the album's title track. He followed up his debut with the equally brilliant That's Life (1994), also for Antone's, and again this recording contains just three self-penned songs. Wilson's career took a boost in the '90s with a major-label deal with Private Music/BMG for the Fabulous Thunderbirds and frequent concert appearances with Bonnie Raitt. Wilson's solo albums are solid productions, highly recommended for harmonica students and fans of classic Texas blues and rhythm & blues. \n\nTickets are valid for one show only.

I was headed that way on the bass, but for me to fully realize what I was hearing in my head sonically I was going to have to do it my way”. His inﬂuential and innovative double bass style eventually evolved into what we see today as That1Guy and The Magic Pipe.<BR> As his story continues to develop, Billboard has famously noted, “In the case of Mike Silverman’s slamming, futuristic funk act... the normal rules of biology just don’t apply.” In addition, Silverman also has new music and videos in theworks for 2015 that will further validate his status as an industry trailblazer. “I like being my own person”, he says. “I didn’t set out to be a weirdo, but I’m starting to embrace it”. Ultimately, his motivation can be encapsulated as this:“Human beings do our best work when we’re challenged and pushed up against the wall”.

This particular conversation we’ve been having in the Deep (house/tech/breaks) arena is particularly dope, and I’m excited to be a participant again by spinning &amp; producing that which moves my ass and soul, and raises my hands to the sky.<BR> <BR> Mixing is my zen-state. It isn’t an intentional act as much as it communion with sound, with the muse.I don’t plan Sets. My mantra is the ‘right song at the right time’, and you’re never going to answer that question until you’re in the moment. I kicked the vinyl habit in ‘05, but I still use CDJs.. You can hear the excitement in a live-mixed set, when there’s no net, when the DJ is a sneeze away from a trainwreck. I like a slippery beat or two, to flash your cards, to show this is real, this is Now, and we’re deep in it, together. I also only like to mix deep, 3 mins or so. It isn’t deep music unless you mix it deep, over your head in sounds, dancing with them as if Tai Chi, rolling them into another as if an Akido master. The tracks dictate how they want to be mixed, the moment dictates what energy wants to emerge next; a DJ isn’t there to be intentional, we’re supposed to be receptive.

He reveals, “We didn’t really know what to expect.  I went to a club – saw Fatboy Slim at Space.  He was standing in for Carl Cox.  Every night I went to every single club. Then I started looking hard at the scene,” and began DJing from there.  </SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #ffffff;\">On the production side, he started gleaning tips from friend Harry Wolfman and combined that with his knowledge of Logic and other bits of his training.  Ever since, he has been slaving away in the studio, developing a variety of his unique strains of dance music.  The linchpin of the sound has always been house, but filtered through an ever-evolving set of lenses: progressive, pop, jazz, and beyond.  </SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #ffffff;\">Young JackLNDN is now poised to move large congregations himself.  His remix and original production slate is stacked for 2012, in addition to his weekly DJ slots.  This classical-turned-dance prodigy has got the musical chops and attention to detail so often lacking in EDM.  To call JackLNDN a bright, young voice might just be the understatement of the year.  </SPAN></P>\r\n<P><BR></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">LOVE + PROPAGANDA</SPAN><BR><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">85 Campton Place</SPAN><BR><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">San Francisco</SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin-left: 40px;\"><BR><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 14px; color: #ffffff;\">For Bottle Service Reservations, email <A HREF=\"http://www.myguestlist.com.au/mgl/link.php?lid=5616fa820075d\" REL=\"nofollow\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #ffffff;\">SOLYLUNASF@yahoo.com</SPAN></A><BR><BR> Feel free to invite your friends and family to this special event!</SPAN></P>\r\n<P><BR></P>",

LOVE + PROPAGANDA is fully equipped with one-of-a-kind visual stimulation and a state of the art Funktion One sound system.  \n  \nJACKLNDN \nJackLNDN is one part classical technician and two parts main room club surgeon.  He’s simultaneously a mixture of centuries of European musical heritage and a sneak preview of the future.  As a producer and DJ, he has quickly established himself as a character whose work is quickly drawing attention for its freshness and whose potential is seemingly endless.  In his twenty years on earth, LNDN has spent more time performing and playing music than most do in a lifetime.   \nBorn in the early 90s, Londoner Jack Aisher spent the majority of youth attending Windsor Castle for the Queen.  He rigorously trained in classical music, developing a slew of skills: choral singing, conducting, writing, and performing cello, piano and guitar.  The immersive education required performing at “8 events a week, 14 hours of rehearsals a week and 30 minutes of training every day before breakfast.  It was like boot camp,” he admits, “but so rewarding.”   \nThen, he met dance music.  On a holiday to Ibiza with a friend, LNDN, a teen, experienced proper clubbing for the first time. He reveals, “We didn’t really know what to expect.  I went to a club – saw Fatboy Slim at Space.  He was standing in for Carl Cox.  Every night I went to every single club. Then I started looking hard at the scene,” and began DJing from there.   \nOn the production side, he started gleaning tips from friend Harry Wolfman and combined that with his knowledge of Logic and other bits of his training.  Ever since, he has been slaving away in the studio, developing a variety of his unique strains of dance music.  The linchpin of the sound has always been house, but filtered through an ever-evolving set of lenses: progressive, pop, jazz, and beyond.   \nYoung JackLNDN is now poised to move large congregations himself.  His remix and original production slate is stacked for 2012, in addition to his weekly DJ slots.  This classical-turned-dance prodigy has got the musical chops and attention to detail so often lacking in EDM.  To call JackLNDN a bright, young voice might just be the understatement of the year.   \n  \nLOVE + PROPAGANDA 85 Campton Place San Francisco \n For Bottle Service Reservations, email SOLYLUNASF@yahoo.com   Feel free to invite your friends and family to this special event! \n  "
